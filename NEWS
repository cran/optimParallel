(1) indexing 'par' by names inside 'fn' works now. 
    e.g. optimParallel(par=c(a=1), fn <- function(x) {x["a"]^2})
(2) using functions and method from loaded packages works now.
    'fn' and 'gr' have now .GlobalEnv as parent environment.
(3) the default value for the argument 'method' is now "L-BFGS-B".
(4) the help page ?optimParallel contains a new section 'Notes' 
    summarizing considerations for the practical use.
